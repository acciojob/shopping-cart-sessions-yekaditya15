# Shopping Cart Sessions

Create a page that displays a list of products. Allow the user to add products to their shopping cart and store the cart data in session storage. If the user leaves the page and returns later, their shopping cart should still be displayed.

Boilerplate code is given to you. You just have to implement the cart functionality
Also, add event listners where required
